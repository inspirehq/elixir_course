# GenServer is a *behaviour* that wraps several lower-level process features
# available directly in the BEAM. Understanding those primitives demystifies
# GenServer and helps when debugging lower-level issues.
# Each numbered block below is executable & independent.

# spawn/1 vs spawn_link/1:
# - spawn/1 creates an independent process. If it crashes, the parent continues.
# - spawn_link/1 creates a process AND establishes a bidirectional link.
#   If either process crashes, the other one crashes too (unless trapping exits).
# This "fail fast" approach helps detect problems early and prevents
# zombie processes from running with corrupted state.

# Step 1: Trap exits so we can handle crashes instead of dying ourselves

# Step-by-step breakdown of the retry pattern:
# task_fun = the function we want to execute (passed in as first argument)
# retry_fn = reference to ourselves for recursion (passed in as second argument)
retrying = fn task_fun, retry_fn ->
  # Step 1: Remember who the parent process is (so spawned process can send back)
  parent = self()

  # Step 2: Spawn a process to run the potentially slow task
  spawn(fn ->
    task_fun.()           # Execute the task (might be slow)

  receive do
    :done ->
      IO.puts("task completed in time - success!")

    IO.puts("taking too long, retryingâ€¦")
    retry_fn.(task_fun, retry_fn)  # Try again (recursive call)
  end
end

# Demo: task that sleeps 1200ms (longer than 1000ms timeout) so it will retry
# Here, task_fun becomes: fn -> Process.sleep(1200) end
# And retry_fn becomes: retrying (reference to the function itself)
_retry_demo = retrying.(fn -> Process.sleep(1200) end, retrying)

# The recursive helper models how libraries implement retry logic with raw
# `receive after`. GenServer abstracts *all* of the above patterns so you only
# write callback functions.

#  Explanation: the spawned process has its own mailbox; by sending the parent
#  the computed sum we avoid shared stateâ€”reinforcing message-passing.

# 2. kv_loop_with_delete/0
