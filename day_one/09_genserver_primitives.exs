# GenServer is a *behaviour* that wraps several lower-level process features
# available directly in the BEAM. Understanding those primitives demystifies
# GenServer and helps when debugging lower-level issues.
# Each numbered block below is executable & independent.

# The recursive helper models how libraries implement retry logic with raw

ANSWERS & EXPLANATIONS

# 1. spawn_sum/2
#{Macro.to_string(DayOne.Answers.answer_one())}
#  This demonstrates the fundamental "client-server" pattern in Erlang/Elixir.
#  The parent process (`self()`) acts as the client, spawning a server process
#  to do some work. The client sends a message and then enters a `receive`
#  block to await the response.

# 2. kv_loop_with_delete/0
#{Macro.to_string(DayOne.Answers.answer_two())}
#  This shows how to extend a stateful process loop. By adding a new `receive`
#  clause for `{:delete, key}`, we can handle a new type of message. The state
#  (the map) is immutable, so `Map.delete/2` returns a *new* map, which is then
#  passed into the next iteration of the `loop`.

# 3. ping_pong/1
#{Macro.to_string(DayOne.Answers.answer_three())}
#  This is a more complex example of two processes communicating. It shows how
#  PIDs are passed around to allow processes to know who to send messages to.
#  The recursive calls with a decreasing counter (`n`) serve as the state that
#  determines when the process should stop.
