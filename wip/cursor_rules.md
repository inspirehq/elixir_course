When generating or editing code you must follow the coding style, naming
conventions and architectural patterns illustrated in these exemplar files:

Context → lib/app/contexts/team/update.ex
Schema → lib/app/schemas/team.ex
Controller → lib/app_web/controllers/api/api_controller.ex
LiveView → lib/app_web/live/account/people/show.ex
Functional Component -> lib/app_web/components/stateless/show_page.ex
Live Components -> lib/app_web/components/state/action_item.ex
Utilities -> lib/app/utils/filter_helper.ex
Services -> lib/app/utils/cloudinary.ex
Workers -> lib/app/workers/notification.ex
Router -> lib/app_web/router.ex

Before proposing a solution, compare it mentally against the closest exemplar(s)
and adjust for consistency. When in doubt, prefer the exemplar’s approach. Always ask before including a different approach. Also, always check and utilize existing utility functions before creating new ones.
